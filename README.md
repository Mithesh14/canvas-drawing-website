# canvas-drawing-website
✏️This is a simple drawing website with basic functions like increasing the size of the brush from 5 to 50, changing the colors of the brushes , etc.
 
###Screenshots and working explained

➡️ By default I made the brush size to be 14, and the color of the brush to be black.

➡️ So if we scribble/draw something on the white board, it will be in the size of 14 and black in color.

➡️ We can change the color of the brush by clicking on the color icon present in the toolbox.

➡️ After clearing the screen using the clear icon in the toolbox, the white board will get cleaned, but the information of the brush which you used last will be saved.
